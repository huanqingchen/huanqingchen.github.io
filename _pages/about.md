I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Science at the [University of Alberta, Augustana Campus](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/augustana/index.html). My research focuses on reionization, a fascinating cosmic epoch where the first generation of galaxies and quasars form and ionize the surrounding intergalactic gas. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and was previously a CITA Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto.

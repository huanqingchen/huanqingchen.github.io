At z=2-4, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman-alpha_forest">Lyman alpha forest</a> 
has provided us with enormous information about cosmology. 
However, at z>=6, most of this information are lost due to saturation in Lya absorption. 
Yet, immediately around a quasar, the ionizing radiation is so intense that hydrogen are fully ionized. 
Such regions thus offer us a new window to peek into the conditions of the intergalactic medium.
